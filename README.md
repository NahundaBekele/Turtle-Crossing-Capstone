## Description

"**Turtle Crossing Capstone**" is a Python project developed using the **Turtle module**. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing program that simulates crossing challenges.

## Features

- **Obstacle Crossing Simulation**: Users can control a character (represented by the Turtle) to navigate through various obstacles.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Users can use arrow keys to move the character.
- **Visual Feedback**: The Turtle graphics provide real-time visual feedback as the character moves.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NahundaBekele/Turtle-Crossing-Capstone.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Turtle-Crossing-Capstone
    ```

4. Run the main Python script:

    ```bash
    Crossing Capstone.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Use arrow keys (UP and DOWN keys) to move the character.
3. Avoid obstacles and reach the end!

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included in Python standard library)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the project, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.
