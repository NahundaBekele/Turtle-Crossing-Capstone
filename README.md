## Description

"Crossing Capstone" is a Python project developed using the **Turtle module**. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing program that simulates crossing obstacles or challenges.

## Features

- **Obstacle Crossing Simulation**: Users can control a character (represented by the Turtle) to navigate through various obstacles.
- **Customizable Obstacles**: The project allows users to define their own obstacles (e.g., walls, rivers, or mazes) using Turtle graphics.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Users can use arrow keys or other custom keys to move the character.
- **Visual Feedback**: The Turtle graphics provide real-time visual feedback as the character moves.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Crossing-Capstone.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Crossing-Capstone
    ```

4. Run the main Python script:

    ```
    python crossing_capstone.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Use arrow keys (or custom keys) to move the character.
3. Avoid obstacles and reach the goal!
